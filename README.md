### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mehmet Oya.

Iâ€™m an Istanbul based Software Developer. A developer who knows perfectly well that i know nothing ðŸ˜„ I love doing research and reading. It's hard to keep up with the speed of technology. I am passionate about building software that improves the lives of those around me. Iâ€™m motivated by product success and business growth, not technology for technologyâ€™s sake âš¡
